# About Me:

Hi there, My Name is Christopher or call me Chris for short.

I'm a curious data wrangler who loves to find meaning in different datasets. This interest came from my degree and time learning Data Science I want my skills to create an impact on people in need. When I'm not interested in data, I'm an amateur cellular photographer who loves taking urban/rural scenery, playing video games such as Elden Ring and Pokemon, and listening to J-rock, Metal, and Pop music. Currently, I am looking for a job where I can utilize my analytics/scientific skills and continue learning how these skills are used in the workplace.
