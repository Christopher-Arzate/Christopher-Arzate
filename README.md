# Hi there, My Name is Christopher or call me Chris for short.

About Me:
I'm a curious data wrangler who loves to find meaning in different datasets. This interest came from my degree and time learning Data Science I want my skills to create an impact on people in need. When I'm not interested in data, I'm an amateur cellular photographer who loves to take urban/rural scenery, play video games such as Elden Ring and Pokemon, and listen to music such as J-rock, Metal, and Pop. At the moment, I am looking for a job to utilize my analytics/ scientists skills to use so i can continue and learn what this skill are used in the work place.
